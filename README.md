<h1>Learntocurie</h1>

In this repository you can find all the code for the manual curation application learntocurie.

This curation application will be used for curating content on [Steemit](http://www.steemit.com)

We're still in development, so we don't have an easy set up yet. But downloading all the files here and running it on your local server should get it up and running.

<h3>SteemConnect</h3>

We use steemconnect v2 for logging into learntocurie, for more information on SteemConnect you can take a look in here: https://github.com/steemit/steemconnect

All you have to change is the sc2.init function in App.js

<h2>Backend</h2>

We still need to work on the backend. We're planning on writing a script that pulls the latest post each time, depending on the filters, and gives us the necessary data for voting, commenting, resteeming

<h2>Demo of frontend</h2>
